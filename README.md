# hackaton-2022

This project was submitted to the [2022 CSTA Hackathon](https://miami.csteachers.org/page/2022-cs-ed-week-celebration).

It was made by 4 students at Stanton College Preparatory school in 6 hours, with everything made by the students (including all artwork, music, and game design). It was inspired by the movie *The Maze Runner*, but we were unable to include all of the features we would have liked due to limited time.

## Gameplay

Controls are WASD. You start at home base and go through the open gate to go into the maze. Your goal in the maze is to collect all three keys, which will randomly spawn when you enter. Once you have collected your keys, you must go back to home base and place them on their pedestal. Once you place all 3 keys, you win. If you stay in the maze for too long, you will start to lose health. Losing all of your health is how you lose. If you go back to base, your health will reset to full and you may go back into the maze again, however the remaining keys that need to collect will be moved randomly.

## Usage

Copy the code in `index.js` and paste it into [Sprig](https://editor.sprig.hackclub.com/?file=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hackclub/sprig/main/games/getting_started.js), then run it.
